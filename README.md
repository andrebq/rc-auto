# rc-auto

This is a simple app to be deployed on a Pi Zero W 1.1 (newer models might work as well),
that can be used to control a simple RC car.

The car design, 3d models, firmware and this app will be open-sourced,
for now, only the main app is available.

This app will eventually handle file upload/editing directly from the browser,
this is mostly useful to avoid adding concepts like SSH to new users (the project
is aimed at children that are interested in coding/robotics).
